# Welcome to brainstorming!
### Jot down notes and concerns here

We need to make sure our stuff is water proof
-Gabe

We need to design a casing for this thing (whoever ends up being the guy without a subsystem he is in charge of can design and 3d print us one based on our hardware discriptions)
-Gabe

There are 3D printers in the Maker's Lab so nobody should have to purchase anything. - Roman

What if we add button you have to rest your chin on and it sprays you if you get up before winning (waterproofing nightmare but hey, we're engineers)
-Gabe

Dr. Shukla wants us to use the ADC so maybe a light sensor you have to keep your chin on or it sprays you preemptively. Or maybe just control tetris by waving hands over light sensors. (or simple photoresistors)

Dr. Shukla wanted a state change and suggested levels one and two (this will make Roman's life hard and probably eat all the RAM with Gabe's music so maybe let's ask her if the "game over" message counts as a state change).
