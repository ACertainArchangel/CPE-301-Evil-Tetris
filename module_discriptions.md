# Welcome to hardware discriptions!
This is where we can list the components and assembly instructions for the circuits needed for our modules.

## Gabe â€” Sound Machine
Components needed:
* Passive Piezo buzzer x3 (standard hobby specs no brand)
* Resistor x3 (very likely 100-200 ohms depending on desired volume and safety level) (no brand)
* Capacitor x3 -> Experement but 10 micro farads is likely good (no brand)
* Jumper wires to make connections (no brand)
* Possibly more and special wire depending on our casing and water proofing capabilities (tbd)
Connect pin 11 to one piezo buzzer through resistor and capacitor to ground
Connect pin 5  to one piezo buzzer through resistor and capacitor to ground
Connect pin 6  to one piezo buzzer through resistor and capacitor to ground
